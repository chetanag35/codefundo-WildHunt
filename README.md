Designing a webapp using Azure Blockchain to ensure:
* Automatic creation of an e-voter ID card soon as an Indian citizen turns 18.
* Secure deletion of an an e-voter ID card by an authorised government officer when an authentic voter expires
* Try to integrate this system with aadhar,such that if for a user aadhar is linked then when a user turns 18 then he/she will automatically added to voter list database.
